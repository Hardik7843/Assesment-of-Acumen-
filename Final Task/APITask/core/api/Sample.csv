It was in high school that I read this quote, and decided I was never going to let fear rule my life. I was 18 years old when I decided to move from Georgia to Hawaii to attend the University of Hawaii. I stepped foot onto the island not knowing a soul or anything about the place. You could definitely say it was a culture shock... However, rather than feeling overwhelmed, I was very intrigued by the different people that surrounded me. 

Within a year of attending the University, I had met and befriend people from all over the world who taught me how to understand and accept one another’s differences. Through exploring the island with all different kinds of people, I learned that in order to be successful, you have to jump. Meeting and communicating with friends, colleagues, and tourist made me realize I never want to be complacent with my life or talents. Each day is a new opportunity to be a better version of yourself than you were yesterday. It is for those reasons, I decided to move to New York City after graduation to compete and learn from some of the most talented people in the world. 

I quickly realized that I had a desire to apart of a team with a more creative work environment. I accepted a job with The Beam Team in 2017 and established strengths in budgeting, time management, and strategy planning.

I am known for redefining traditional business models, driving profitable growth and generating sources of revenue through innovative strategies that leverage people, technology and data-driven improvements. 
 
While at PNC, I played an integral part in the success, growth, and modernization of the PNC retail bank branch franchise.  I played key leadership roles over my career in PNC’s journey from being a $12B asset-sized bank when I started my career to the $550B+ asset sized bank it is today.  

Most recently, as head of US Retail Branch Banking and Physical Distribution, I led the branch and ATM network, managing the division’s P&L, risk profile, and an annual expense budget of more than $1B. Providing balanced leadership during unprecedented times of change in our organization’s history, I successfully directed the physical and cultural integration of the branch and ATM network following the acquisition of the BBVA USA 500-branch franchise, hiring executive leadership teams and expanding into new markets. 

Leading with integrity and positivity, I take a forward-thinking approach to advancing growth by supporting people.  I make it a priority to build collaborative and inclusive teams - from frontline workers to senior directors. As a founding member of PNC’s women’s employee resource group, I am passionate about promoting diverse talent and creating leadership teams that closely mirror the demographics of those they serve. 

My superpower is to combine visionary financial strategies with engaging human capital leadership strategies. I coach executives to successfully navigate complex changes, drive organizational transformation, scale businesses effectively, and make significant advances in their careers. 

I've spent many years coaching and developing executive leaders during my career.  I am now CEO of my own coaching practice, Executive Edge Associates, LLC. I coach executives as an independent practitioner and hold a Board-Certified Coach credential from the Center for Credentialing and Education. 

My career has taken me to new locations – Pittsburgh, Chicago, and now Atlanta -  and I’ve played an active role in each community. I currently serve on the Board of Trustees for the Atlanta Ballet.

Dear Friends & Colleagues-- 

 I have been mentored in a way which has always hammered home knowing one's strengths and weaknesses (because we all have them, and knowing them is half the battle). 

 I will begin by opening up and identifying clearly my weakness to you up front...in a word, monotony. I thrive on my strength in creating new ideas and implementing new concepts in hopes of never becoming stagnant and always pushing the boundaries. 

 To be clear, there is absolutely a need for those who can practice and complete tasks repetitively and precisely, however, that is just not my area of expertise. I like to represent myself as the creative problem-solving mind in action where guidelines and instructions may not currently exist.

🌟 What I've learned along the way is this: regardless of the business model—be it home-based, MLM, franchising, or corporate—success hinges on one vital element: teamwork. It's the backbone of every thriving enterprise, and it's the key to unlocking our fullest potential.

🌟 My fascination with the Laws of the Universe and the perpetual pursuit of personal development fuel my passion. I firmly believe that knowledge empowers and that by lifting others, we enrich not only our lives but the lives of those around us.

🌟 My goal? To make financial freedom a reality for anyone willing to seize it. To create a life where you can cherish every moment with loved ones while still achieving remarkable financial success. Together, let's embark on a journey of growth, leadership, and fulfillment.

An engineer at heart, I love solving business, technical, financial and organizational problems - the more complex and greater the reward, the greater the enjoyment in attacking the problem. I am fiercely focused on TEAM building with a mission to support individuals and TEAMs in reaching their full potential. A former college athlete and current wannabe athlete, I am in constant quest of TEAM victories that raise expectations of where our collective potential can take us. 

I gravitate to businesses that have traction but need TEAMs, systems and processes that scale. I believe the core VALUEs of honesty, integrity, humility, clarity, respect and accountability are pre-requisites for success. My TEAMs have consistently been honored with numerous awards on local, national and international levels for growth, respect of employees, philanthropic work and innovation. 

I am currently the senior executive of PrimeRevenue, supporting 25,000+ clients in more than 70 countries. Our clients have millions of employees and $100’s of billions of dollars in revenue. We are proud to unlock cash that is trapped in their supply chain to fund their strategic initiatives like growth, M&A and R&D.  Our multicultural TEAM supports clients from offices in 7 countries, hail from dozens of countries and speaks 20+ languages.

I also enjoy working with select, high-potential entrepreneurs, CEOs and TEAMs that are changing the world in big ways. I always make time for students that are trying to form their view of the world. I prioritize my charitable efforts on organizations that support children or communities in need and I never give money to a cause that I won’t give my time.

When I am not working or traveling, I can be found with my family somewhere in a boat, at the beach, on a hiking trail, on a ski slope or participating in some other outdoor activity (as long as Georgia Tech isn’t playing that day!).

I’ve been a builder and creator since I was a kid. My love for Legos and Lincoln Logs eventually migrated to technology and companies. I built my first website at 15 and started my first company in high school.

I’m one of the rare Atlanta natives that’s still here, and I developed my obsession with supply chain and warehouses at Georgia Tech (ISyE 2015). After spending my early career working in supply chain software at firms like Manhattan Associates, I started what would be my third company in 2020 — PorterLogic.

PorterLogic is a composable supply chain tech stack built for mid-market manufacturers and value-add distributors. Our platform gives supply chain teams the systems they need to maintain their competitive advantage without being forced into a box by packaged solutions. Spreadsheets don’t scale, and custom systems are expensive and hard to maintain. PorterLogic brings unprecedented flexibility with lower TCO than traditional systems.

Being a founder and CEO is more than a 9-5 job, and you can usually find me working somewhere along the Atlanta beltline.

My career is vast and diverse, spanning leadership, coaching, talent development, employee relations, and consultation, among others. 

My HR experience is further enriched by my strategic and operational business acumen, which is bolstered by a Juris Doctorate from the University of Alabama, School of Law. This legal background has not only broadened my understanding of the legal aspects of HR but also equipped me with the necessary skills to navigate complex HR issues with confidence and precision. 

I have served as a trusted advisor to C-level executives, where I have translated business goals into HR strategies. I possess a strong set of cross-functional, collaborative, and inclusive, diversity-centered skills that have inspired trust and credibility. I have managed employee relations for employees in AL, TX, CO, NY, AZ, CA, FL, and NM employees. 

Here's a glimpse of the significant impacts I've made in my career:

• I was a Human Capital Risk Consultant for HR Business Partners, Talent Acquisition, and Compensation teams, where I provided support for a wide scope of HR issues, including Title VII, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the American Disabilities Act, Family Medical Leave Act, termination, disciplinary actions, and various state laws.
•  I served as a project manager for developing and implementing training for leadership teams that not only boosted engagement, policy, performance management, and employee relations but also led to a significant 15% reduction in escalations over a six-month period. 
• I collaborated on the integration of department-wide performance and quality standards that improved employee satisfaction by 30%.
• I implemented leadership curriculum development and introduced one-on-one engagement sessions that improved leadership competencies.
• By overhauling compensation, promotion, and recruiting policies, I cut turnover by 30%.",2024-07-08T05:09:17.850Z,,6.1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The University of Alabama School of Law,Doctor of Law - JD,Law,2002.06,2005.05,"Best Paper, Transactional Drafting / Corporate Law",Talladega College,BA,Finance & Banking,,,Magna Cum Laude / Departmental Distinction / Alpha Chi National Honor Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,5331,DISTANCE_3,FALSE,5086,07-06-2024 16:11,2024-07-06T10:41:36.665Z,07-08-2024 10:39,2024-07-08T05:09:56.306Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,9b91388cc2f232db5f4aa19a59687b4a

In 1982, Baunchi HGS ""aka"" Captain Zoom, launched QTEEM during a time when national concerns intensified for youth displaying deficits in the areas of education, leadership, self-esteem, prevention, and positive character traits.  

Baunchi started his career in early childhood education in the early 1970s. His creation of Zoom Music Factory Inc. featured the Captain Zoom character in collaboration with the US Department Head Start Program at the Akron Board of Education. Also in the 1970s, he started manufacturing educational materials for youth ages six months to 12 years old.
 
Eventually, Baunchi became a certified Trainer of Trainers for the US Department of Public Health Center of Substance Abuse Prevention in the areas of Conflict Resolution, Community Organizing, Community Changes, and Alcohol-Tobacco and Other Drugs (ATOD) Prevention; and Trainer of Trainers for the CSAP Institute for African American Mobilization.   

Over the years, he continued collaborative partnerships development with various entities, such as: 
    Interdenominational Theological Center - ITC,
    US Department of Disease Control,
    US Department of Education,
    US Department of DEA,
    US Department of Environmental Control,

Mining the wealth of health science discoveries gets me up in the morning with anticipation. Healthspan is of particular interest. 

Collaberation at Scale
Today it seems my life is increasingly impacted by decentralized computation and our crowd-resourced world and the shared pull our generation feels towards significance over success. Crowd development, crowd design, and crowd fulfillment are redefining the concept of collaboration on an unprecedented scale. 

New Translational Healthcare Models
Healthcare is not exempt from these movements towards a new world of how we do business. Increasingly, over the last 15 years, my world has moved towards the expanding global markets of Asia, India, and China more recently. While COVID redefined our relationships with foreign markets and China in particular we still have a lot to gain from our understanding of and lessons from ""them and us"". The foundations of a 21 Century model for health care, inclusive of incorporating the edge of science and technology, offers enticing promise for new frontiers to address the long struggled-over areas of care reform, translational medicine, personalized treatment, cell health, immunology, healthier longer longevity, and care augmented by AI.

Team Playing
I value the synergy and personal satisfaction of working in a team environment that challenges individual performance and fosters an inspiring community. For this reason, I have come to place as much value on who people are and how we work well together than skills, experience, and industry equity. Opportunity and returns have become more about Who than What. We are drawn to demonstrations of performance excellence and expertise, yet for me, it is from collaborative partnerships and shared commitments where those flourish and offer the most reward. 

Team Rules
In an effort to build a rewarding life journey both professionally and in life generally, I have chosen to align with those who can share the following team operating principles:

•  Demonstrate gentleness, dignity, and respect     
•  Communicate with frankness, honesty, and clarity
•  Avoid blame and pettiness   
•  Keep agreements   
•  Assume good intentions   
•  Ask for help 
•  Seek mentors     
•  Take risks; learn from what doesn’t work     
•  Take ownership of outcomes
•  Attack problems, not people     
•  Innovate embracing science and technology frontiers  
•  Do it all with integrity, enthusiasm, and joy",2024-07-08T07:32:24.658Z,,7.22,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Andrews University,Coursework in Masters of Divinity,Religon,1979,1981,,Southern Adventist University,AS,"BS, Construction, Religion",1975,1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,1150,DISTANCE_3,FALSE,1144,07-06-2024 16:13,2024-07-06T10:43:08.843Z,07-08-2024 13:03,2024-07-08T07:33:03.717Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,9b6962f40b1f730a379eac9c1acc588a

The ones with offers to buy your business. Your dopamine skyrockets when you see the numbers...

$5M...$10M...$100M...

These are what we call ""prop"" offers. 

Time and time again, we've seen owners succumb to the temptation of selling their business blindly based on these unsolicited offers...

Not knowing they give up most - if not all - control over the exit when they fly blind into these deals.

Business owners, we know exactly what you want: The right price for your business and a deal on your terms.

So you can exit WITHOUT any regret.

You crave control. It's been coded into your DNA since birth.

That's also why you became a business owner in the first place, right? To have total control and power over your time and income.

The only way you can get both is if you pull the 3 levers to any successful business exit:

➡️ Control over the transaction process
➡️ Developing a competitive market for your business
➡️ Identifying a broad scope of ideal buyers

Let me show how we've helped hundreds of business owners secure the right deal on their terms.

The PowerExit™ Strategy is our proprietary process to

1) Create confidential exposure by properly marketing the business sale for you to the right parties
2) Discover the true valuation of the business and implement systems to maximize the sale price
3) Introduce you to a broader scope of ideal buyers that ready to buy on your terms

You didn't build a business - and lifestyle - only to have it be derailed by a poorly executed exit...and not taking home the highest dollar amount possible.

If you are looking to sell your business and want the best deal on your terms then simply leave me a note and let's find time to talk.

With giving back to others being at the core of what drives me, I’ve been able to utilize over 25 years of experience and knowledge to propel others’ growth. Some accomplishments I’m most proud of include:

- Being recognized with the 2023 Service Award, 2021 Outstanding Teaching Award and 2020 Lee Anne Seawell Faculty Recognition Award while lecturing at The University of Georgia - Terry College of Business

- Assisting about 4-500 students per year polish their resumes and find jobs through 1-on-1 consulting

- Building and launching eCommerce programs at multiple brands, including taking Broadway Audela’s BarelyXtensions from 0 online sales to 30% online sales growth each month

- Launching the University of Georgia Supply Chain Advisory Board

- Crafting and executing many successful Supply Chain programs through consulting and as a fractional COO

- Becoming a “Supply Chain Influencer” so that I can share my insights with a larger audience, both on social media and by appearing as a guest on podcasts, news broadcastings and other forms of media

Though those are some accomplishments I’m proud of, this season of life isn’t about my own ambition but instead about stepping back and finding ways to help others shine, even if it means jumping into entirely new situations and fields. 

When I’m not busy helping others grow, you can find me getting busy in the kitchen, spending time with my family, and occasionally belting out Brick House by The Commodores if you’re lucky (contrary to my wife’s opinion on it).

I'm Alicia L. Fitch, a creative professional with over a decade of experience in UX design, digital marketing, and brand development. Through my work, I have been able to connect with people from all walks of life and help businesses grow worldwide.

My love for design sparked after I secured a post-grad internship at a small events agency, Esyntial Elements. I loved the fast-paced environment and the opportunity to collaborate with clients on creating unique event experiences. It was there that I discovered my talent for creating visuals and bringing ideas to life through design.

My internship experience led me to found Brighter Affairs, an event planning business where I managed and executed over 100 remarkable events, including national conferences, tradeshows, and corporate galas. This venture honed my skills in project management, client communication, and creative design.

In 2019, I pivoted by launching Brighter Ink Studios. Here, I merged my entrepreneurial spirit with design expertise, crafting 20+ distinctive brand identities and providing brand support to more than 50 clients.

Now, as a Senior Designer at ManageMint (formerly Kishshana & Co.), I lead innovative projects that boost user engagement and brand recognition. 

Apart from my love for art and design, spending time with my family brings me the most happiness. When I'm not immersed in the world of design or chasing after our little ones, you'll find me in the kitchen. I'm always excited to experiment with new recipes, so if you have one that you think is too good to keep to yourself, please don't hesitate to share it with me!

I joined the company in 2005 after graduating magna cum laude with a bachelor’s degree from Appalachian State University. My journey at RPS began with the role of Project Manager and I moved up the ranks very quickly. Prior to assuming the role of CEO and Creative Director, I held the role of Account Executive and Art Director. In my current position, I oversee the vision and direction of the company, as well as working with my team to develop brands that connect with our clients’ audiences and marketing solutions that help our clients grow their businesses.

I am also a certified EMyth Business Coach. Having gone through a year of coaching with the EMyth program myself, I know the value of having an individual outside of the company to discuss challenges and successes with and bounce ideas off of. The coaching I received helped RPS work through the challenges of the economic recession of the late 2000s, and I realized that I wanted to help others work through the challenges that business owners face, which lead me to become a coach with EMyth in 2013.

In addition to my commitment to RPS and our clients, I am actively involved in a number of professional and civic organizations such as the Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce, Leadership Gwinnett, Community Foundation for Northeast Georgia, Janus Institute, Gwinnett Coalition for Health and Human Services, Aurora Theatre, Barefoot in the Park Fine Art Festival, and Rotary Club of Lawrenceville, among others.

This can come from the desire to grow due to stagnation or shrinkage, or because your organization is ready to grow. 

In order to grow, most organizations need to change what they are currently doing and thinking. We know what it takes to help an organization to change. Change starts with asking hard questions to get to the core of who a business is and what it will take to really move the needle, and we are really good at asking the hard questions so that we can then create solutions to solve these problems with your branding and marketing efforts.

We create brands that reflect our clients and the hard work they put in that makes them so successful. Our business-based, creative strategy not only brings fresh ideas to the table, but also gives clients the opportunity to truly describe, and often discover who they are and how they want their brand to reflect that. 

We firmly believe that collaboration is one of the greatest components of a successful brand and growth strategy. We don't believe in having just clients, but instead creating partnerships. Truly understanding your organization’s anatomy [mission, vision, and values] allows us to fully invest and grow as a business partner. This means that your growing pains are our growing pains, we celebrate your victories like they’re our own, and we use all of those experiences to refine your marketing strategy moving forward.

Some of the more notable brands I have worked with include: CDC, Cabbage Patch Kids, Carry-On Trailer, Pigtails & Crewcuts, Discovery Point Childcare Centers, Swoozies, United Supply Company, Usher Foundation, Community Foundation for Northeast Georgia, Aurora Theatre, Janus Institute, Gateway85 Gwinnett CID, and City of Duluth to name a few.

I’m inspired by ambitious tech innovation projects that aim to be ethically bold and globally impactful. Working at the frontiers of emerging tech, I use my PhD-training in neuroscience and ethics to lead strategic tech visioning that incorporates ethics design thinking to help align innovator values with societal interests. Dedicated to cross-sectoral dialogue, I’m frequently called upon as trusted advisor, collaborator, and convener of high-level global stakeholders across academia, industry, and government to create actionable recommendations and policy. As an internationally recognized speaker and commentator, I enjoy bringing insights and facilitating opportunities for shared discovery and co-creation of solutions for today’s (and tomorrow’s) thorniest ethical issues in tech.

I worked the first half of that career in the NASA/Department of Defense world and eventually made my way to the commercial side in the mid-1990s.  At one point I was the Director of Systems Engineering for a large-scale Air Force project and from there made my way into project and program management.

As my parents became elderly and handicapped, I took on more of an eldercare role for them as they made their respective ways through their final years.  In 2010 I decided to transition out of IT and into real estate in the Austin, Texas area.

It was in 2016 that a friend of mine and I decided to join forces to start up Sought + Found.  With the growth of that business came an additional opportunity to help clients not only with the home they were selling, but also the new home they purchased.  My business partner and I decided to startup a new business in 2018 to address those projects and we called it Designing Your View.  We also decided it was best to bring on a full-time interior designer to handle the incoming and ongoing clients.

We became authorized dealers for both the Hunter Douglas and Graber product lines so that we could offer clients the best options in the industry for window coverings.  And with the changes in how/where people work due to the pandemic, our interior designer is able to help clients anywhere in the continental United States with virtual consultations for window coverings.

Through my work I’ve filmed the Special Olympics World Games in Abu Dhabi, embedded in protests on the streets of Johannesburg, followed a single mother to work on a potato farm in Romania, documented LeBron James playing around with his sons before winning his third NBA MVP award, investigated workers rights on a shipyard in Alabama, and everything in between. 

As the Founder and President of Studio IX, a nonprofit organization working to level the playing field for womxn in film, I work to provide emerging filmmakers with the resources, confidence and funding needed to create a documentary short film used to help break into the industry and sustain a career. 

Prior to launching Studio IX, I was the Director of Glassbreaker Films an initiative funded by The Helen Gurley Brown Foundation dedicated to finding and funding women directors in nonfiction film. During my time with Glassbreaker Films, including a partnership with The Center for Investigative Reporting, I oversaw the production of over 30 short films and several digital series. My team was nominated for a National News and Documentary Emmy Award, won an  Edward R. Murrow Award and a Gracie Award; published on platforms such as Netflix, NYT Op Docs and PBS; and premiered at festivals around the world, including Sundance, SXSW, Hotdocs and Tribeca.

Before transitioning to documentary full time, I was an on-camera anchor for Sports Illustrated’s breaking news video team, SI Wire, and I worked as a video producer for the Miami Heat, covering back-to-back NBA championships.

My passion for science is rooted in discovery, making my transition to business development a natural progression.

From engineering patented innovation to spearheading acquisitions to imagining opportunities in new markets, I have a proven track record for business incubation and long-term growth. This includes conceptualizing and building what is now Lubrizol Life Science, a thriving Lubrizol business innovating chemistry for fast-growing beauty, home and healthcare applications.The incubation and growth of Lubrizol Life Science required strategy development, organizationaldesign, global immersion in healththcare markets and several large pharmaceutical and medical device acquisitions. This enabled Lubrizol to invent novel patient-focused products and services, affecting the lives of billions of people.

In my current role as Senior Vice President of Lubrizol Corporate Ventures, I challenge an inspired team as we lean into Lubrizol’s 90 years of chemistry expertise to develop, formulate, test and commercialize breakthroughs, turning challenges into opportunities for our partners. My team of seasoned scientists, engineers and business leaders work in partnership with our customers to facilitate innovations in emerging, high-impact industries, driving the hydrogen, electric, and energy ecosystem.

Novel technology energizes me, and I’m so proud to have been recognized with the R&D 100 award and the NorTech Innovation award for pioneering commercial products. I feel strongly that transforming the world should not come at the cost of the planet. That’s why I’m pleased that so much of our work is rooted in sustainability with opportunities to help the world Move Cleaner, Create Smarter and Live Better.

Forward thinking mentors – both men and women – have supported me throughout my career as a chemical engineer and as a business leader. I’m fortunate that this has included on-the-job mentorship, as well as education by leaders as part of Wharton’s executive training. Mentors and sponsors have afforded me the insight and support needed to break through glass ceilings, so I in turn, do my best to offer the same to future women in STEM.

I've run a Christian Virtual Business Incubator for fifteen years, worked with more than eight hundred sixty-five clients, and started ten companies in ten different markets with ten different business models.

The first two were train wrecks, the next three were six figures, and the last three seven, and I can share a few ideas I've found valuable.

The 40-40 Plan (40 hours/40 years), is that God's best for our lives? 
Is that all there is?

""And you shall remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as it is this day."" Deuteronomy 8:18.

According to this verse and many others, we don’t believe the ""40-40"" plan is all there is for Christians who actually believe. 

And since God is love, that means that His covenant is a love covenant. 

In the Kingdom, we are taught to love people and use money. 

After all, it's money that funds ministries, builds hospitals, feeds children, and rescues the trafficked.

More money = more good.

In the world's system, it's the opposite; we are taught to love money and use people. 

We believe in the biblical principle of earning our financial and time independence, with God's power, by building simple virtual business machines that can eventually operate 100% without us.

We do this by building simple, predictable, and dependable ""Service First"" businesses based on uncompromising and unapologetic Christian Biblical principles. 

We need a Mentor, a Business Model, and a bulletproof Mindset.

And do it with humility and humor.

If you are looking for leadership that helps move your organization forward, let's talk.  My experience would be of interest to you. I have a long history of inciting change with large, multi-national corporations, the State Department in Washington DC, and successful entrepreneurial startups in the technology and public service arenas. 

With my experiences and my network of connections, I know how to drive results. 

In my experiences, I’ve motivated some of the top people in their field, from science and technology to public policy and community building, to achieve new and innovative pursuits. We all win when we strive to grow beyond our current area of expertise. 

You’ll see from my profile that I built a track record of success with many organizations in a variety of circles. I can bring my network to you to cultivate new possibilities in areas you may never have before considered. My profile includes non-profit leadership, board service, government service and senior leadership in a corporate structure. I bring a business perspective that focuses on what direction should be taken and why those decisions should be made. 

I’ve led organizations in developing their technological programs to keep pace with the industry standards and best practices. I know that if you’re not planning for tomorrow’s advances, you’re planning to fall behind. 

Currently I am considering opportunities in the Austin, Texas area where I can utilize my talents to bring about positive change in an organization that is open to bold, new ideas and approaches to their business model. This organization could be a corporation, a non-profit, or a government entity. The one constant I seek is the willingness to grow.  Faster.

1. TexasSnacks.com - We're the first and world's largest unofficial re-seller of Buc-ee's products.

2. MiningSyndicate.com - We sell hardware, services and software related to crypto mining.

3. FastTreeCare.com - DFW-based tree trimming company that we incubated from scratch with an operating partner in the summer of 2023. We are rapidly expanding and having a ton of fun.

4. Voltera - Healthcare AI startup that helps skilled nursing facilities save 5-6 figures per year.

5. RV/MH Parks - We own an RV park in Waco, TX and I am a GP on a large RV park in Louisiana as well.

6. cofounders.com - This is the holdco for most of everything above. We fund undergrads and provide them with a salary, training and a business idea to launch alongside us. It's a lot of fun.

7. Content - I write ~40,000 words of free, longform business content every month between X, LinkedIn and to 7,000+ newsletter subscribers. This content is read by 20-30 million people every month and is perfect for fellow business nerds.

8. Other - I am always tinkering with and/or incubating a few other stealth ideas at any given time.

I have a deep passion for entrepreneurship, writing and real estate. My writing attempts to put all 3 together.

I live in DFW on a few acres with a beautiful wife of 16 years and 4 kids ages 7-13.

A few more unique things about me:

- My wife and I each donated a kidney to a stranger so say thanks to the boy who donated his lungs to my daughter. I'm deeply passionate about altruistic kidney donation.

- I saw all 50 states in 60 days with my family in an RV

- After being obese for my 20s, I lost it all and ran 15 ultramarathons and hold records in several of them

- I partnered with the legendary John McAfee on a crypto project in 2018

- After being rejected by Buc-ee's to be the first to sell their products online, I went ahead and did it anyway, with my good friend and cousin Kirk Salisbury. That is now a thriving 7 figure company.

- I have started over 20 companies and absolutely freaking love what I do. Business is my hobby, profession and passion, and it doesn't feel like work.

His philosophy is to paint what he feels, while making a contribution to humanity intellectually as an Artist with his paintings, and the love of art. Without creativity and love, the human race, will die sleeping, loosing its intellectuality. To be a fully awake conscious human, one must use the six elements mind, body, soul, passion, ego, and finally creativity.

Dortch has procured investments and/or funding from his vast network of venture capitalists, angel investors, and debt financiers such as the Small Business Administration. Dortch has created innovative media technologies and brands. As an entrepreneur, Dortch is always looking for new projects and would love to discuss any ideas you may have.

During an internationally televised broadcast, Shanghai Media Group (""SMG"") said, ""video production and distribution market in China was worth nearly 10 billion Yuan"" and Dortch's content was described by SMG as being ""amazing."" Dortch said, we ""have shots all over the world, from some of the highest peaks of Everest, to some of the lowest places on Earth"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g4f4shw5Dk).

During an interview conducted by the Daily Herald, Dortch spoke of digital media and its role in the Chinese government: ""For me, there is a deeper mission,"" Dortch said. ""We will be contributing to positive media to build a better society"" (http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/central/orem/orem-s-cmg-partners-with-chinese-multimedia-group/article_cdcff92d-9876-5042-9c58-143f299b2ae7.html).

Newswriter Debra Lordan of Pacific Media Group wrote the following about Dortch, ""The idea to preserve and honor the area through photos and film footage fits perfectly with Dortch’s former career as a National Geographic photographer and cinematographer, where he digitized and distributed multimedia content online"" (http://bigislandnow.com/2018/07/02/preserving-memories-of-kapoho/).

Markee Magazine described Dortch's company: ""It’s easy to see why the company’s artsy collection is noteworthy, as Dortch points out that the company’s cinematographers have acquired content 'in hundreds' of national parks, in addition to a more recent and more daunting task: spending 'several weeks with the U.S. military shooting high-speed footage of C4 explosions, machine guns, operating shots from Chinooks, Black Hawk helicopters and many other military vehicles,' Dortch said (http://markeemagazine.com/wp/stock-footage-houses/).

Adobe called the digital imagery created by Dortch's company, “amazing, stunning work” that caused “Goosebumps in the audience!” (https://spark.adobe.com/page/PhCchABGO2URV/).",2024-07-14T07:44:40.410Z,,2.22,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Utah Valley University,Bachelor's Degree,Digital Communication and Multimedia,1999,2007,#NAME?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Murad Currawalla,,Murad Currawalla,,,,14550,DISTANCE_2,FALSE,14634,07-07-2024 23:55,2024-07-07T18:25:55.630Z,14-07-2024 13:15,2024-07-14T07:45:39.805Z,07-06-2024 13:01,2024-07-06T07:31:59.509Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,9b45d42cba1d336a1cd7c3ef8a2fd1ec

For the past 25 years, I've been immersed in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. I’ve been in the field; I know what it’s like. I did not become a PM by reading a book - I got my hands dirty – a LOT.

I’ve done it all, from SCADA networks to microwave shots. From defense and government to energy, utilities, and telecommunications, I witnessed firsthand the transformative power of IT and the web, launching a start-up back in the Dotcom days. This furthered a deep interest in pursuing entrepreneurial routes, finding and exploring new ways of creating market efficiencies, across all industry verticals.

Technology isn't just my business; I describe it as a constant wellspring of thorny curiosity. Just when I think the value-add of technology has diminished, something new comes out which makes me think, “OK, maybe we can go a bit further.” Right now, the possibilities of micro-nuclear reactors, Robotics, AI and machine learning hold particular interest for me. 

In addition, we’re still figuring out ways and building models for identifying highly skilled talent in this current, rather difficult marketplace. This child of inspiration and angst is my LLC, Locum Integration LLC, which has been in operation since 2013. 

This idea for “doing” the market differently commenced with our Locum “On-Demand PMO” model which we trademarked in 2016. It allows companies to spin up and utilize IT-PMO services as needed, on the fly, without recruiters or needing to put a person in a seat full-time. This well documented, well protected model often has me feeling like Michael Burry in “The Big Short” – lol - but I’m not wrong. (More on this later as the rest of the world catches up to the inevitability).

To give myself a voice and a platform, I've even built a state-of-the-art 4-camera, 4K digital media studio at home, a testament to my ongoing exploration. You should see this thing!

Whether you're tackling groundbreaking projects in AI, defense, government or energy, or seeking operational efficiencies in the hospitality sector, I'd love to connect and kick ideas around! 

I’m focused only on Corp-to-Corp opportunities and entrepreneurial activities at this time. Not interested in any W2 situations. I believe in the power of collaboration to push the boundaries of what's possible.

I have worked across its sub-domains including product management & strategy, economic research, financial journalism, market research, content development and training. 

My professional Interest and focus have always been to conceptualise, design, develop and implement financial and insurance products. The micro understanding of financial needs and risk appetite of target customers and macro understanding of economy and behavioural finance inspired me to conceptualise various financial products which are aligned to their financial goals/needs. The intangible nature of financial products/solution requires a 360 degree approach embedding various considerations including security of investments, expected yield, return variability, time horizon, investment expense, marketability/liquidity preference and tax benefits. I believe the products may be generic but solutions must be specific to the needs of an individual. The transition from product to solution is the key differentiator.  As an entrepreneur, I have tried to create a platform which would work towards this goal.

I have learnt a lot while nurturing, guiding, challenging and mentoring my team to achieve professional excellence. I believe the path to excellence drives through clarity of purpose and empowerment. I trust in my team and create alignment with the purpose to achieve business goals.

A first time entrepreneur, clueless but passionate, I let go of my 8 years of financial services experience. Nyassa was started in end of 2006

Nyassa was my modest but passionate attempt to create handmade soaps with ingredients that are absolutely nature-made. The encouragement  from our customers  has made us progress from a recognizable soap maker to a desirable bath & body products brand today.
 
Over the next few months, you will see a whole new range of Nyassa products that not only reflect our continued commitment to bring you  products of unmatched luxury and exceptional value, but  also demonstrate a refreshing philosophy shaped by our deeper understanding of our customers needs, likes, and wants.  We call this thinking ‘From Heaven and Earth’. Imagine the most exotic and mesmerizing of fragrances, exquisite and indelible, romantic and dreamy; Imagine a whole basket of pure and wholesome natural ingredients, from the bosom of the earth, beneficial to your skin and body; Now imagine them coming together harmoniously, elegantly, almost divinely, in a bath soap, or a body butter,or a handwash, or a face cream.
This is Nyassa. The best of heavenly fragrances together with the best of earthly ingredients. The coming together of two worlds creating an exciting new one. 
 
Everytime you pick up a Nyassa, you know everything about it. Like it is 100% vegetarian,we use no preservatives,no SLES or SLS in our products & are against animal testing.

6 yrs is not a long time,but we have come a long way.And we feel closer to nature than ever before. In the coming days, we will scour the earth and sweep the heavens to bring you the best of fragrances and the best of ingredients.That’s my promise.
